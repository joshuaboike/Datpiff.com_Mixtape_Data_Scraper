mixtapeScraper
==============

Using the open source Scrapy framework, this Python program scrapes, and performs calculations on, data from popular hip-hop mixtape websites, using XPath to navigate each HTML file. The data collected and calculated includes mixtape duration, number of features, number of tracks, and month of release, and more. This information will be analyzed to determine the most significant factors affecting mixtape download count. 

UPDATE: The only significant factor with an alpha value above 0.05 was Views. To gain a better understanding of what determines mixtape success, I will be expanding the program to include social media numbers, growth rates over time, and blog coverage. Coming soon!
